Curiefense is an API-first, DevOps oriented web-defense HTTP-Filter adapter for Envoy. It provides next-generation WAF capabilities and real-time traffic monitoring and transparency.

Curiefense is fully controllable programmatically. All configuration data (security rulesets, policies, etc.) can be maintained singularly or as different branches for different environments, as you choose. All changes are versioned, and reverts can be done at any time.

Curiefense also has a UI console, discussed in this Manual in the Console and Analytics sections. 

If you are unfamiliar with Curiefense, please start by reading the Architecture and Overview.
